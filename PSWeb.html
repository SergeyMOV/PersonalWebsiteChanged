            <p>
              ojsoifjaosjd oapods I was born in Armenia, in a city Yerevan. I
              graduated from secondary school there. Since childhood I was
              fascinated by computers and found this field interesting. After
              finishing secondary school it so happened that I moved to Germany.
              When I came to Germany after a few integration courses i started
              to look for an IT education and I found Webex Technologies
              Educational Platform, where I learned the basics of Web
              programming (Html, Css and Javascript).After this experience I was
              determined to become a Professional Web Programmer.So i started an
              advanced Web-Programming course at the Institute neue Fische to
              learn how to do it professionally and to work in this field in the
              future.
