            <hr />
            <p>
              I was born in Armenia, in a city Yerevan. I graduated from
              secondary school there. Since childhood I was fascinated by
              computers and found this field interesting. After finishing
              secondary school it so happened that I moved to Germany. When I
              came to Germany after a few integration courses i started to look
              for an IT education and I found Webex Technologies Educational
              Platform, where I learned the basics of Web programming (Html, Css
              and Javascript).After this experience I was determined to become a
              Professional Web Programmer.So i started an advanced
              Web-Programming course at the Institute neue Fische to learn how
              to do it professionally and to work in this field in the future.
